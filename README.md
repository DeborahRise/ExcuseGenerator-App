# An Excuse Generating App
Hillarious right?! I know! Let me take you through this fun App.

# About The App
Now you no longer an Excuse not to have an Excuse with this Excuse generator App.

For now, this App can only help you generate excuses for 6 aspects of your life:
- Work
- Family
- Party
- Developers
- Funny
- College

We will cover more areas in the near future so you will never be without excuses whatever the situation. lol!

## How It Works
Click on any of the buttons that suits the excuse that you are trying to generate, and voila! you now have an excuse! You are welcome.

## Under the Hood
For this App, the excuses are generated using an API '`https://excuser-three.vercel.app/v1/excuse/${excuseee}`'
My thinking is, based on statistics and some kind of questionnaire, various excuses have been collected stored in a database and now we have access to this DB using an API.

## Teaser
The is one excuse I really Love:
"[{"id":514,"excuse":"I saw many strangers following my car so I took the longest route possible to reach today.","category":"funny"}]"

- **P.S**
The excuses are returned as an object, so I had to use the dot notation to target the actual excuse
